<p>A celestial map from the 17th century, by the cartographer Frederik de Wit
Cartography or map-making is the study and practice of crafting representations of the Earth 
upon a flat surface (see History of cartography), and one who makes maps is called a cartographer.<br/>
Road maps are perhaps the most widely used maps today, and form a subset of navigational maps, 
which also include aeronautical and nautical charts, railroad network maps, and hiking and bicycling maps. 
In terms of quantity, the largest number of drawn map sheets is probably made up by local surveys, 
carried out by municipalities, utilities, tax assessors, emergency services providers, and other local agencies. 
Many national surveying projects have been carried out by the military, such as the British Ordnance Survey: 
a civilian government agency, internationally renowned for its comprehensively detailed work.
In addition to location information, maps may also be used to portray contour lines 
indicating constant values of elevation, temperature, rainfall, etc.</p>
